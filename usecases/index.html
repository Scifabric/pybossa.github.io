                <h2>I've a set of PDFs where my OCR does a very bad job</h2>
                <p>You are covered! PyBossa can import any PDF file and render it for your users, so you can extract any information from them, like tables! All you have to do is upload your PDF files (with scanned images included, no problem!) to your Dropbox account (PyBossa is integrated with Dropbox) or host them in your own web server. Then, use one of our ready-to-use templates to extract the information that you want.</p>
                <p id="longPdfMore" class="collapse">The templates allow you to zoom in and out from the PDF (this is pretty handy when documents are written by hand) and move between pages. A task could involve the analysis of a full document, or just a few pages. It's up to you to decide. Moreover, due to the PyBossa.JS library you can integrate your template with third party online services like Open Corporates or Encyclopedia of Life to run queries about the data contained in the PDFs, so your users can input the best possible information. Simple yet advanced!</p>

                <h2>I need to analyze a video archive</h2>
                <p>Videos show motion, expressions, and action and sometimes analyzing them becomes difficult. Specially when you have to interpret the actions taken in the video. For this reason, we've built ready-to-use templates that will allow you to import your videos directly from Dropbox or Vimeo (more to come) to analyze them.</p>

                <p id="longVideoMore" class="collapse">The templates allow you to ask questions about what's going on the videos, as well as tagging specific parts of them, selecting the starting and end time of the action/feeling/event that you want to analyze. This could be something like identifying places where the video was recorded, or who is being shown on the video, what actions are happening as well as getting feedback about how people are feeling when watching specific parts of the video.</p>
