                <h2>I've a set of PDFs where my OCR does a very bad job</h2>
                <p>You are covered! PyBossa can import any PDF file and render it for your users, so you can extract any information from them, like tables! All you have to do is upload your PDF files (with scanned images included, no problem!) to your Dropbox account (PyBossa is integrated with Dropbox) or host them in your own web server. Then, use one of our ready-to-use templates to extract the information that you want.</p>
                <p id="longPdfMore" class="collapse-text">The templates allow you to zoom in and out from the PDF (this is pretty handy when documents are written by hand) and move between pages. A task could involve the analysis of a full document, or just a few pages. It's up to you to decide. Moreover, due to the PyBossa.JS library you can integrate your template with third party online services like Open Corporates or Encyclopedia of Life to run queries about the data contained in the PDFs, so your users can input the best possible information. Simple yet advanced!</p>

                <h2>I need to analyze a video archive</h2>
                <p>Videos show motion, expressions, and action and sometimes analyzing them becomes difficult. Specially when you have to interpret the actions taken in the video. For this reason, we've built ready-to-use templates that will allow you to import your videos directly from Dropbox or Vimeo (more to come) to analyze them.</p>

                <p id="longVideoMore" class="collapse-text">The templates allow you to ask questions about what's going on the videos, as well as tagging specific parts of them, selecting the starting and end time of the action/feeling/event that you want to analyze. This could be something like identifying places where the video was recorded, or who is being shown on the video, what actions are happening as well as getting feedback about how people are feeling when watching specific parts of the video.</p>

                <h2>I have to geolocalize a photo archive </h2>
                <p>You love photos, and you have a huge set of them. However the problem is that most of them are very old photos, and there is no such a thing like EXIF data (or meta-data) in them. To geolocate them you just use our Flickr or Dropbox integration to import your pictures and ask people to geolocalize them!</p>
                <p id="longGeolocalizeMore" class="collapse-text">The Flickr importer will allow you to select albums from your account, making very simple to import large amounts of photos with just one click! Then, use one of our templates to geolocalize the pictures using web maps. The data will store the latitude and longitude as well as the GeoJSON information of your choice, so you can render that info in any third party software. Get the crowd helping you to geolocalize those amazing locations in the pictures!</p>

                <p>You are birdwatcher, and you record the singing of the birds. You have now a big set of audio clips of different birds singing and you need to identify them in every audio clip. Simply import the audio clips from your Dropbox account (or SoundCloud) and use the tagging sounds template.</p>
                <p>The template will allow your users to specify the starting and ending point where a specific bird is singing, making really simple to tag and classify those lovely birds in your audio clips.</p>

Imagine that you can use this tool to actually ask people who is talking in that secret record that a whistleblower sent you about an important case. You can effortlessly protect your work with a password, so only those who know the password can access your project and can help you to tag who's talking and when the crime is spoken in your audio files.</p>

                <h2>I have to transcribe audio and/or video</h2>
                <p>Yesterday one of the biggest events on TV was finally aired. All journalists from your country followed the debate between the major political parties for the elections, and now you would love to address this story with new eyes. But first comes first: you need to transcribe the audio from the videos or the radio records and that takes lots of time and effort, so why not crowdsource it with your audience?</p>
                <p id="longTranscribeMore" class="collapse-text">With PyBossa, tasks like transcribing an audio/video file are really easy. All you have to do is to import the recording into PyBossa with one of our available importers, Flickr, Dropbox, Google Spreadsheets, SoundCloudâ€¦ and mix our transcription templates with our audio/video ones to create what you need. Thanks to the flexibility of PyBossa you'll be able to create your automated transcription platform where your audience will help you to transcribe. Or you can ask them too, to express how do they feel about the words said by the political leaders.</p>

                <h2>I have to classify images</h2>
                <p>
                You have thousands of images from a trap camera, a microscope or an archive and you need to classify them. You know the algorithms will do a poor job because the images are a big mix of different features, making almost impossible to classify them, opening the door to miss some important stuff. Therefore you are looking to get some people involved to help you, as people like you can do a better job than computers alone.</p>
                <p id="longClassificationMore" class="collapse-text">
                If you feel identified, then, use our Flickr or Dropbox importer and start classifying, counting, describing your images out of the box. We provide ready-to-use templates that address these problems easily providing a responsive interface, so your volunteer could even contribute from their phones or tablets.</p>
