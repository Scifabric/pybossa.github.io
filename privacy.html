                <h2 class="">PYBOSSA Privacy Policy</h2>

                <p>Please read this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) carefully. </p>

                <p>When you access PYBOSSA this policy binds you.
                When you create an identity on PYBOSSA you are a
                Contributor and as a Contributor you accept and consent to the
                practices described in this Privacy Policy. This Policy is
                effective as from [25/May/2018].</p>

                <h3>Amendments and Updates to this Policy</h3>
                <p>PYBOSSA may amend this Privacy Policy from
                time to time to reflect regulatory requirements or changes in
                our information collection, use or disclosure practices. If
                this Privacy Policy is changed, the new Effective Date will be
                noted here. You should therefore view this Page regularly to
                view our most up-to-date Privacy Policy. </p>
                <h3>Linking Websites </h3>
                <p>It is obvious but this is a reminder that this Privacy
                Policy does not apply to any third-party sites accessed via
                links from PYBOSSA. PYBOSSA has
                no control over what those sites do with information which
                they collect so it would be absurd to claim that
                PYBOSSA has any responsibility for what those
                sites do. If you want to protect yourself then carefully
                read through any third-party privacy policies before
                agreeing to their terms or using such third party websites.
                </p>
