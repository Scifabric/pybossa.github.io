The British Museum and University College of London has set up a platform (powered by PyBossa) that invites members of the public to become citizen archeologists. The project aims to create the world’s leading prehistoric metal database and change the way we research our collective past.

The British Museum’s Bronze Age collection contains over 30,000 tools and weapons discovered during the 19th and 20th centuries. Specific details of each artefact are recorded in a massive database of index cards which has been kept since 1913. The Micropasts project seeks contributions to help create 3D models of these artefacts using a process known as photomasking, to transcribe their associated paper records and to identify their sites of discovery.

The Micropasts team have created over 100 projects (doing do archival transcription and geo-referencing of hand-written cards, as well as photo-masking to support 3D object modelling from the Bronze Age era) and is at the forefront of crowdsourcing humanitarian research.
