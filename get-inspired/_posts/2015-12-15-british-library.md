LibCrowds’ maiden project – Convert-a-Card – use PyBossa to ask volunteers to transcribe text from printed card catalogues into electronic records in order to make them available to a worldwide audience. The project is initially focused on the library’s Asian and African collections, particularly the Chinese and Indian catalogues. Data identified, transcribed or translated as part of the project will be freely accessible from the British Library’s Explore catalogue.
