The institute created the project Rural Geolocator hosted in Crowdcrafting (powered by PyBossa) to ask the public to identify houses in satellite images, currently of two locations in Africa: Rusinga Island in Lake Victoria, Kenya and Majete Wildlife Reserve in Malawi.

Field teams trying to stop the spread of Malaria need to deliver technologies and advice to indigenous populations to prevent them from contracting the disease. To deliver these tools, the teams need to know where people live. While they try their best to visit everyone, inevitably they miss some people out who, perhaps, live in remote areas which are difficult to access. Rural Geolocator helps to ensure that the field teams can visit everyone in a particular district, using the geo-coding facilities of PyBossa.

The institute need help to analyse thousands of satellite images (imported from Bing) to locate structures where people might live. There is a diverse range of possibilities of what constitutes a ‘potentially inhabitable structure’ that only the human brain can interpret. The institute couldn’t use computer algorithms for these tasks.
