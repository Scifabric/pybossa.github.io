The guardian newspaper wanted to bring more transparency to New South Wales (Australia)  pecuniary interests, and they used PyBossa to achieve it making the first crowdsourcing project using our technology. In New South Wales politicians are required to declare details of gifts, investments, business interests, and other items that could influence their decisions in parliament. They do this in the pecuniary interests register. However, half the New South Wales pecuniary interests register has never been viewable online by the public, and the other half is hard to find. All of the declarations are only available as scanned PDFs, sometimes handwritten, which makes it difficult to properly scrutinise the register.

They used PyBossa to transform human readable documents into machine readable documents, publishing a search interface and a data set in Github.
