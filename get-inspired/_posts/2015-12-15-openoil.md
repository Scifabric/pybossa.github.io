Open Oil is a Berlin-based publishing house, working on transparency around extractive industries. One of its key aims is to make oil contracts more open, and they used PyBossa to achieve it. Open Oil has set up a project in Crowdcrafting (powered by PyBossa) to help analyse oil industry contracts. Open Oil asks contributors to identify the full legal name, abbreviation, jurisdiction and OpenCorporates ID in each contract.
