                <h2>British Museum and University College of London</h2>
                <p>The British Museum and University College of London has set up a platform (powered by PyBossa) that invites members of the public to become citizen archeologists. The project aims to create the world’s leading prehistoric metal database and change the way we research our collective past.</p>

                <p>The British Museum’s Bronze Age collection contains over 30,000 tools and weapons discovered during the 19th and 20th centuries. Specific details of each artefact are recorded in a massive database of index cards which has been kept since 1913. The Micropasts project seeks contributions to help create 3D models of these artefacts using a process known as photomasking, to transcribe their associated paper records and to identify their sites of discovery.</p>

                <p>The Micropasts team have created over 100 projects (doing do archival transcription and geo-referencing of hand-written cards, as well as photo-masking to support 3D object modelling from the Bronze Age era) and is at the forefront of crowdsourcing humanitarian research. </p>

Data identified, transcribed or translated as part of the project will be freely accessible from the British Library’s Explore catalogue.</p>

                <h2>The Guardian</h2>
                <p>The guardian newspaper wanted to bring more transparency to New South Wales (Australia)  pecuniary interests, and they used PyBossa to achieve it making the first crowdsourcing project using our technology. In New South Wales politicians are required to declare details of gifts, investments, business interests, and other items that could influence their decisions in parliament. They do this in the pecuniary interests register. However, half the New South Wales pecuniary interests register has never been viewable online by the public, and the other half is hard to find. All of the declarations are only available as scanned PDFs, sometimes handwritten, which makes it difficult to properly scrutinise the register.</p>

                <p>They used PyBossa to transform human readable documents into machine readable documents, publishing a search interface and a data set in Github.</p>

                <p>Open Oil is a Berlin-based publishing house, working on transparency around extractive industries. One of its key aims is to make oil contracts more open, and they used PyBossa to achieve it. Open Oil has set up a project in Crowdcrafting (powered by PyBossa) to help analyse oil industry contracts. Open Oil asks contributors to identify the full legal name, abbreviation, jurisdiction and OpenCorporates ID in each contract.</p>

                <h2>Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute</h2>
                <p>The institute created the project Rural Geolocator hosted in Crowdcrafting (powered by PyBossa) to ask the public to identify houses in satellite images, currently of two locations in Africa: Rusinga Island in Lake Victoria, Kenya and Majete Wildlife Reserve in Malawi.</p>

                <p>Field teams trying to stop the spread of Malaria need to deliver technologies and advice to indigenous populations to prevent them from contracting the disease. To deliver these tools, the teams need to know where people live. While they try their best to visit everyone, inevitably they miss some people out who, perhaps, live in remote areas which are difficult to access. Rural Geolocator helps to ensure that the field teams can visit everyone in a particular district, using the geo-coding facilities of PyBossa.</p>

                <p>The institute need help to analyse thousands of satellite images (imported from Bing) to locate structures where people might live. There is a diverse range of possibilities of what constitutes a ‘potentially inhabitable structure’ that only the human brain can interpret. The institute couldn’t use computer algorithms for these tasks.</p>
