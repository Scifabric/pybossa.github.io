title: I need to analyze a video archive
---
Videos show motion, expressions, and action and sometimes analyzing them becomes difficult. Specially when you have to interpret the actions taken in the video. For this reason, we've built ready-to-use templates that will allow you to import your videos directly from Dropbox or Vimeo (more to come) to analyze them.

The templates allow you to ask questions about what's going on the videos, as well as tagging specific parts of them, selecting the starting and end time of the action/feeling/event that you want to analyze. This could be something like identifying places where the video was recorded, or who is being shown on the video, what actions are happening as well as getting feedback about how people are feeling when watching specific parts of the video.
