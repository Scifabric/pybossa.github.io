title: I have to geolocalize a photo archieve
---

You love photos, and you have a huge set of them. However the problem is that most of them are very old photos, and there is no such a thing like EXIF data (or meta-data) in them. To geolocate them you just use our Flickr or Dropbox integration to import your pictures and ask people to geolocalize them!

The Flickr importer will allow you to select albums from your account, making very simple to import large amounts of photos with just one click! Then, use one of our templates to geolocalize the pictures using web maps. The data will store the latitude and longitude as well as the GeoJSON information of your choice, so you can render that info in any third party software. Get the crowd helping you to geolocalize those amazing locations in the pictures!
