title: I need to tag/identify sounds of a video
---
You are birdwatcher, and you record the singing of the birds. You have now a big set of audio clips of different birds singing and you need to identify them in every audio clip. Simply import the audio clips from your Dropbox account (or SoundCloud) and use the tagging sounds template.

The template will allow your users to specify the starting and ending point where a specific bird is singing, making really simple to tag and classify those lovely birds in your audio clips. 

You might not be a biologist, but a journalist. Imagine that you can use this tool to actually ask people who is talking in that secret record that a whistleblower sent you about an important case. You can effortlessly protect your work with a password, so only those who know the password can access your project and can help you to tag who's talking and when the crime is spoken in your audio files.
