title: I have to transcribe audio and/or video
---

Yesterday one of the biggest events on TV was finally aired. All journalists from your country followed the debate between the major political parties for the elections, and now you would love to address this story with new eyes. But first comes first: you need to transcribe the audio from the videos or the radio records and that takes lots of time and effort, so why not crowdsource it with your audience?

With PyBossa, tasks like transcribing an audio/video file are really easy. All you have to do is to import the recording into PyBossa with one of our available importers, Flickr, Dropbox, Google Spreadsheets, SoundCloudâ€¦ and mix our transcription templates with our audio/video ones to create what you need. Thanks to the flexibility of PyBossa you'll be able to create your automated transcription platform where your audience will help you to transcribe. Or you can ask them too, to express how do they feel about the words said by the political leaders.
