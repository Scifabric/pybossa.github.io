title: I have to classify images
---
You have thousands of images from a trap camera, a microscope or an archive and you need to classify them. You know the algorithms will do a poor job because the images are a big mix of different features, making almost impossible to classify them, opening the door to miss some important stuff. Therefore you are looking to get some people involved to help you, as people like you can do a better job than computers alone.
If you feel identified, then, use our Flickr or Dropbox importer and start classifying, counting, describing your images out of the box. We provide ready-to-use templates that address these problems easily providing a responsive interface, so your volunteer could even contribute from their phones or tablets.
