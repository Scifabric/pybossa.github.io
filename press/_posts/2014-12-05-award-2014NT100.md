Crowdcrafting is part of the 100 most inspiring companies around the world,
according to the Nominet Trust 100 of 2014, which was unveiled in London on
Thursday 4 December.


The Madrid-based company earned a spot on this list, selected among others by
the Google Ventures General Partner, Tom Hulme, Wayra Europe Director, Simon
Devonshire, being considered the world’s most diverse open source software
platform for so-called citizen science projects, those that seek active,
collaborative and disinterested involvement of citizens in science.

This makes it possible to connect with a large workforce quickly and
inexpensively, and helps to complete tasks that any researcher or individual
can design and implement.

Crowdcrafting has been included in the NT100 2014 thanks to projects like
FrackFinder whose volunteers took just a month to classify thousands of aerial
images of Pennsylvania online to build an accurate picture of fracking in the
US state; also Digital Humanitarian Network worked with the site to classify
tweets for its Philippines Typhoon project which allowed to bring aid to those
affected more efficiently.
As part of its public purpose, the Nominet Trust 100 is held for the second
year supported by Nominet, one of the world’s largest Internet registries.

The projects, which are active in over 200 countries, are using technology to
tackle some of the world’s biggest social problems from education and human
rights abuses to climate change and health.

Since it was established in 2008, Nominet Trust is focused on funding internet
based projects that have a positive impact on the lives of individuals and
communities, especially those most vulnerable or disadvantaged.
