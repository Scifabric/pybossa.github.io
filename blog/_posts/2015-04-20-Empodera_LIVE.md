## You were a keynote speaker at the Empodera LIVE conference last month, what was it all about?

[Empodera LIVE](http://live.empodera.org/) is an international symposium that brings together creative people who are involved in developing social technology. It aims to generate tools for social innovation and citizen empowerment.

## Where was the conference held?

In sunny Málaga in southern Spain. We were privileged to be hosted in one of the best venues in the city: the new [Echegaray Theatre](http://www.teatroechegaray.com/). It is located on the ‘Island of the Arts’, close to the Picasso Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts and the Plaza de la Merced.

## What were the key messages of your presentation?

I talked about Citizen Science and how citizens are helping to shape the future of science, and argued that science affects all of us, and needs all of us. I presented several [PyBossa](http://pybossa.com/)-powered projects hosted in [Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org/) to showcase how citizens can take action to make our world a better place. For example, at Crowdcrafting you can [fight the tiger mosquito](http://crowdcrafting.org/project/Tigafotos/) or [light pollution](http://crowdcrafting.org/project/LostAtNight/) from the comfort of your own sofa.

## Did anyone ask any tricky questions?

I was asked about the reliability of our results, which is a great question. I explained how PyBossa and Crowdcrafting require at least 30 different people to analyse each task before it is considered ‘complete’. So our results are statistically very trustworthy.

## Did you find other talks inspirational?

Yes, [Michael Anti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Anti_%28journalist%29) (or “Zhao Jing”) delivered a fascinating talk about free speech. His experiences and stories were great examples of why it matters to have free speech on the Web.

## Did you meet any interesting people?

I felt privileged to meet [Amel Fahmy](http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Sexual-harassment-hammering-dow) (co-founder of [HarrasMap](http://harassmap.org/en/) and managing director of women’s research centre [Tadween](http://tadweenpublishing.com/blogs/news/7950543-the-fight-against-sexual-harassment-on-arab-campuses)) and [Zaina Erhaim](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/zaina-erhaim) (project coordinator for the [Institute of War and Peace Reporting](https://iwpr.net/)). Amel is doing amazing work fighting for women’s rights, while Zaina is one of the bravest people I've ever met: she is reporting about the Syrian war while living in one of the most dangerous cities of the world. Remarkable people doing remarkable work.

## How was the food and drink?

Really good, as you would expect in the south of Spain. Great fish and ham. The local wines were also really tasty.

## What key lesson did you take away from the conference?

That there are wonderful people in the world fighting for the rights of others and trying to build a better world for us all.

## Will you go back next year?

If I can YES! It was wonderful and I recommend the event to anyone interested in changing the world.

## And you’ll bring your teammate who lives in cold, wet England… right?

Haha… absolutely!*
