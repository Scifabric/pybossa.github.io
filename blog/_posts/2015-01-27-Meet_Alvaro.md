**Hi Álvaro**

Hi James

**How are you feeling?**

I feel pretty good.

**Are you ready for the Irish Inquisition?**

Ready as I ever will be…

**Ok, let’s do this. Who are you?**

I am Álvaro, a 31-year-old guy with a passion for technology and design. 

**Where are you from?**

I was born, raised and live in Madrid. I LOVE Madrid. My parents and grandparents are from the city too, so I am known as a “Gato” or "Cat" in Spain.

**Why’s that?**

In the 11th century, when Madrid was under Arabic rule, the city was under siege by Alfonso VI. One of his soldiers managed to climb the city walls and changed the Moorish flags to Christian flags. They say he climbed with the agility of cat. The story became legend and now all Madrileños (people from Madrid) are called “Gatos”.

**Interesting. What keeps you occupied in Madrid?**

Well, I have studied photography, communications and web design, and worked as a photographer, graphic designer and web designer. Last year I finished a course on digital product design at La Nave Nodriza. And now I have started working as a UX designer.

**What does a UX designer do exactly?**

The role of a UX, or user experience, designer is to understand how a user feels when they use a website, and give them the tools and functionality that they need and want. And of course, I also have to make websites look pretty.

**You've just become Scifabric's new UX Designer, how do you feel?**

I feel very excited. I am really happy about being part of this team because I think we are helping people to change the world.

**What will be your first task at PyBossa?**

The first thing is to put myself on the team page so that everyone knows where I am working! After that I have lots to learn before I can start help to make PyBossa and [Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org/) even better.

**What is your favourite Crowdcrafting project?**

I love the [Open Oil Project](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/openoil/) which aims to make the oil industry more transparent. I am sure the findings of this project will have a big impact around the world.

**What excites you most about the job?**

PyBossa’s team are awesome and I have tons to learn from them.

**Do you have any cool hobbies?**

I love travel, photography and 80s music. Each year I try to learn something new and in 2015 I plan to learn Chinese. 

I also have a Shar Pei dog called Asia, I love to play with Asia.

**Does Asia speak Chinese?**

No.

**Does she chase you up trees Gato?**

I think it’s time to terminate the interview.

**Agreed.**
